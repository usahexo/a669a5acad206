<p>The Warriors swept all four games against the Pelicans during the regular season, but New Orleans is a different team now that they’ve gotten through the first round.</p>
<p>In their opening series win over Portland, the Pelicans showed they have multiple players who can score and an offense that is difficult to defend.</p>
<p>“We know they’re a great team,” said Warriors forward Draymond Green. “But we also feel like we’re a great team.”</p>
<p>Golden State had some issues in their opening series against San Antonio, but they were able to pull out the victory in six games. The Spurs gave the Warriors problems with their defense and their ability to keep Golden State from scoring easily.</p>
<p>Stephen Curry had an up-and-down series against San Antonio, but he averaged nearly 26 points per game in the series. Kevin Durant averaged 27 points per game in the opening round.</p>
<p>“We have to make it tough on them,” said Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday. “If we do that, I like our chances.”</p>
<p>New Orleans will need Anthony Davis to continue playing at an MVP level if they want to have a chance against Golden State. Davis averaged 29 points and 13 rebounds in their opening series win over Portland.</p>
<p>The Warriors are still the favorites to win this matchup, but New Orleans has shown they can compete with anyone when they’re playing their best basketball.</p>
<h1 id="Pelicans-looking-to-cash-in-on-their-future-bets-and-take-down-Golden-State"><a href="#Pelicans-looking-to-cash-in-on-their-future-bets-and-take-down-Golden-State" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans looking to cash in on their future bets and take down Golden State"></a>Pelicans looking to cash in on their future bets and take down Golden State</h1><p>For the first time in a while, the New Orleans Pelicans have some good news to share. Their young stars are starting to produce and they look like they could be a playoff team in a few years.</p>
<p>This offseason, the Pelicans will have to make some decisions about their future. They could trade some of their young talent for veterans to try and make a run now, or keep them together and hope they continue to develop.</p>
<p>Either way, the Pelicans are in a good position. They could potentially get something valuable in return for their players or they could watch them turn into superstars. Golden State is still the team to beat, but with the right moves, the Pelicans could be right up there with them.</p>
<h1 id="Anthony-Davis-and-DeMarcus-Cousins-could-lead-New-Orleans-to-foot-their-competitors"><a href="#Anthony-Davis-and-DeMarcus-Cousins-could-lead-New-Orleans-to-foot-their-competitors" class="headerlink" title="Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins could lead New Orleans to foot their competitors"></a>Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins could lead New Orleans to foot their competitors</h1><p>In the Western Conference, there are a few teams that are considered contenders. Teams like the Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, and San Antonio Spurs are always in the conversation. However, there is a new challenger in town that has not been talked about as much. The New Orleans Pelicans have superstar players in Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins and they could lead their team to foot their competitors.</p>
<p>Davis is a five-time All-Star and he is coming off of his best season yet. He averaged 28 points per game on 51% shooting from the field. He also averaged 11 rebounds per game, 2.2 assists per game, 1.5 steals per game, and 0.9 blocks per game. He did all of this while playing only 35 minutes per game. This season, he will be playing alongside Cousins who is also a superstar player.</p>
<p>Cousins is a four-time All-Star and he is coming off of his best season yet too. He averaged 27 points per game on 49% shooting from the field. He also averaged 11 rebounds per game, 5.4 assists per game, 1.6 steals per game, and 1.3 blocks per game. He played 36 minutes per game last season and this season he will be playing alongside Davis who can take some of the pressure off of him.</p>
<p>The Pelicans have arguably the best frontcourt in the NBA with Davis and Cousins and they also have good players around them too like Jrue Holiday, Rajon Rondo, Nikola Mirotic, E’Twaun Moore, Tim Frazier, Darius Miller, Solomon Hill, Omer Asik, Cheick Diallo, and Tony Allen. They were able to make it to the playoffs last season with their injury-riddled squad but they were quickly eliminated by the Golden State Warriors in four games.</p>
<p>With a healthy squad this season, they could make it further into the playoffs. The West is wide open this season with teams like the Spurs losing Kawhi Leonard and Manu Ginobili, the Rockets losing Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute, and the Thunder losing Carmelo Anthony. These teams could easily fall out of contention this season which would leave an opportunity for teams like the Pelicans to take their place as one of the top teams in the West.</p>
<p>Davis and Cousins are two of the most dominant players in the NBA and they could lead their team to foot their competitors this season.</p>
<h1 id="Could-this-be-the-year-the-Pelicans-foot-the-bill"><a href="#Could-this-be-the-year-the-Pelicans-foot-the-bill" class="headerlink" title="Could this be the year the Pelicans foot the bill?"></a>Could this be the year the Pelicans foot the bill?</h1><p>This could finally be the year that the New Orleans Pelicans make a significant push in the NBA playoffs. With their dominant frontcourt of Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as newly signed Rajon Rondo, they are in prime position to make a deep postseason run.</p>
<p>There were high hopes for the Pelicans last season, but they ultimately fell short due to injuries and inexperience. This year, however, they have a more seasoned roster and should be able to make a real playoff run. Cousins has emerged as one of the top players in the league, and Davis is quickly becoming a superstar.</p>
<p>Rondo is also an excellent addition to the team. He is a veteran point guard who knows how to win championships, and his experience will be invaluable to the Pelicans. He is an excellent passer and ballhandler, which will help take some of the pressure off of Davis and Cousins.</p>
<p>The Western Conference is wide open this year, so there is no reason why the Pelicans can’t make it to the NBA Finals. With their talented roster, they have what it takes to compete with any team in the league. They just need to stay healthy and play together as a team.</p>
<p>If things go according to plan, New Orleans could be hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy this season. The sky is the limit for this exciting young team, so get ready for some fireworks in the Big Easy!</p>
<h1 id="Pelican’s-hopes-rest-on-the-foot-of-DeMarcus-Cousins"><a href="#Pelican’s-hopes-rest-on-the-foot-of-DeMarcus-Cousins" class="headerlink" title="Pelican’s hopes rest on the foot of DeMarcus Cousins"></a>Pelican’s hopes rest on the foot of DeMarcus Cousins</h1><p>The Pelican’s ownership has been very busy in the past few months. They made a number of trades, signings, and are expecting big things from their new roster. One player in particular is DeMarcus Cousins. The Pelicans offered him a 5-year, $127 million dollar contract this offseason, which he accepted.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the Pelicans are hoping Cousins can lead them to a championship. He is a dominant player who averaged 27 points and 10 rebounds last season. If he can stay healthy and continue to play at that level, the Pelicans will be a force to be reckoned with in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>However, there are some concerns about Cousins. He is known for being temperamental and has been involved in several off-the-court incidents. If he can’t keep his emotions in check, it could cause problems for the Pelicans.</p>
<p>Another issue facing the Pelicans is their lack of depth. They only have 7 players on their roster who averaged more than 10 minutes per game last season. If any of those players get injured or struggle early on, the Pelicans could be in trouble.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the Pelicans are still a talented team and have a chance to make a run at the NBA Championship this season. DeMarcus Cousins gives them a chance to compete with anyone in the league, and if he can stay out of trouble they have a good chance of making it to the playoffs.</p>
