      Tax Rate for Online Wagering in Las Vegas Cut in Half

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Tax-Rate-for-Online-Wagering-in-Las-Vegas-Cut-in-Half"><a href="#Tax-Rate-for-Online-Wagering-in-Las-Vegas-Cut-in-Half" class="headerlink" title="Tax Rate for Online Wagering in Las Vegas Cut in Half"></a>Tax Rate for Online Wagering in Las Vegas Cut in Half</h1><p>On February 19, 2019, the Nevada governor signed Assembly Bill 5 into law, which reduces the tax rate on wagers placed online from 6.75% to 3.25%. This move is designed to make Nevada more competitive with other states in terms of attracting bettors.</p>
<p>The reduction in the tax rate is expected to have a positive impact on the state’s gaming industry, with estimates that it could lead to an increase in revenue of $19 million per year. This will help to offset the $1.3 billion in losses that the industry has seen over the past four years.</p>
<p>Governor Steve Sisolak applauded the passage of the bill, stating that it would help to “revitalize our gaming industry and create new jobs in Clark County”. He also noted that the measure would make Nevada “the most attractive place in the country for online wagering”.</p>
<p>Industry insiders are also bullish on the prospects for AB5. John Benvenuti, president of Las Vegas-based consulting firm Spectrum Gaming Group, said that it was a “very positive development” that would help to make Las Vegas “the center of the gambling world once again”. He added that it could also lead to an increase in investment by casino operators in Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-Becomes-More-Tax-Friendly-for-Online-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Becomes-More-Tax-Friendly-for-Online-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Becomes More Tax-Friendly for Online Casino Gambling"></a>Las Vegas Becomes More Tax-Friendly for Online Casino Gambling</h1><p>As one of the most gambling-friendly states in the US, Nevada is seeing a surge in its online casino industry. And while brick-and-mortar casinos have been lobbying hard for tax breaks to keep up, the state has finally responded by passing a bill that exempts online casino revenues from certain taxes.</p>
<p>The new legislation, which was signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval on June 5th, reduces the amount of business taxes that online casinos must pay from 4.95% to 2%. It also removes the 1% Live Entertainment Tax that was previously applied to all gambling revenues, including those generated by online casinos.</p>
<p>This move is seen as a major victory by the online casino industry, which has been fighting for similar tax breaks since its inception. The fact that Nevada has finally agreed to give these businesses a break is seen as a sign that this industry is here to stay, and that other states may soon follow suit.</p>
<p>“We applaud Governor Sandoval and the Nevada Legislature for their support of our industry,” said Jason Ader, CEO of New York-based Dusk Till Dawn Casino. “This legislation will help us continue to grow and create jobs in the Silver State.”</p>
<p>Nevada’s decision comes at a time when other states are also reevaluating their stance on online gambling. In Pennsylvania, for example, lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would legalize it within the state. If passed, this would make Pennsylvania the fourth US state to legalize online casino gambling (along with New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia).</p>
<p>So why is online casino gambling becoming so popular? One reason is that it offers players more convenience and flexibility than traditional brick-and-mortar casinos. You can play from anywhere you have an internet connection, and you can choose from a variety of games that appeal to different interests.</p>
<p>Another factor driving this growth is regulatory uncertainty in other countries. With more stringent regulations coming into effect in places like Australia and Italy, many gamers are choosing to stick with reputable sites based in jurisdictions like Malta or Gibraltar. This shift towards offshore operators has been a boon for the online casino industry, which now accounts for almost half of all global gaming revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Slashes-Taxes-on-Online-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Nevada-Slashes-Taxes-on-Online-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Slashes Taxes on Online Gambling Revenue"></a>Nevada Slashes Taxes on Online Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Nevada has voted to slash taxes on online gambling revenue in an attempt to attract more operators to the market. The state currently imposes a 6.75% tax on gross gaming revenue, but this will be reduced to 0.25% from July 1st 2019.</p>
<p>This move comes as Nevada faces increased competition from other states such as New Jersey, which has seen a surge in online gambling revenue in recent years. In March 2019, online gambling revenue in New Jersey reached $48.8 million, marking a 33% increase year-on-year.</p>
<p>Nevada lawmakers hope that the tax cut will help the state keep pace with its rivals and attract new operators to its market. Assemblyman Jim Wheeler said of the bill, “It’s critical that we do everything possible to make Nevada an attractive place for these companies to locate and do business.”</p>
<p>The move is also likely to benefit taxpayers in Nevada, as it is expected to generate an additional $7 million in revenue annually.</p>
<h1 id="New-Tax-Regime-in-Nevada-Could-Boost-Online-Casino-Industry"><a href="#New-Tax-Regime-in-Nevada-Could-Boost-Online-Casino-Industry" class="headerlink" title="New Tax Regime in Nevada Could Boost Online Casino Industry"></a>New Tax Regime in Nevada Could Boost Online Casino Industry</h1><p>Since Nevada legalized online gambling in February 2013, the industry has been growing steadily. With a new tax regime taking effect from July 1, 2017, the Nevada Gaming Commission expects the growth to continue.</p>
<p>The new tax regime replaces the previous system of progressive taxation with a flat tax of 10%. This is good news for the industry as it will encourage investment and spur growth.</p>
<p>Under the old system, operators had to pay taxes based on their gross gaming revenue (GGR), which varied depending on the type of game being played. This created a lot of uncertainty and interfered with business planning. The new system is simpler and easier to administer.</p>
<p>Another positive change is that online poker players will now be taxed at the same rate as other casino games. This leveling of the playing field should help to attract more players to online poker rooms.</p>
<p>Commission Chairman Tony Alamo Jr. commented on the changes, saying: “We believe that this new tax structure will provide a much-needed boost to the industry, while still providing a level playing field for all operators.”</p>
<p>The commission predicts that the new tax regime will result in an increase in GGR of 5-10%. This would bring total GGR to around $1 billion per year, making Nevada one of the world’s leading online gambling jurisdictions.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Cuts-Taxes-on-Internet-Gambling-Hoping-to-Lure-Operators"><a href="#Nevada-Cuts-Taxes-on-Internet-Gambling-Hoping-to-Lure-Operators" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Cuts Taxes on Internet Gambling, Hoping to Lure Operators"></a>Nevada Cuts Taxes on Internet Gambling, Hoping to Lure Operators</h1><p>Nevada is hoping to lure online gambling operators to its state with the recent passage of Assembly Bill 269, which creates a new class of licensure for internet gambling and reduces the tax burden on operators.</p>
<p>The bill was passed by the Nevada Legislature on May 22, 2019 and signed into law by Governor Steve Sisolak on June 5. It will go into effect on October 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Under the new law, internet gambling operators will be licensed as “non-restricted gaming licensees” and will pay a reduced tax rate of 6.75%, down from the current rate of 10%.</p>
<p>The bill’s sponsor, Assemblyman Michael Sprinkle, said that it is designed to make Nevada more competitive with other states that have legalized online gambling, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“This legislation modernizes our regulations to include all forms of internet gaming while also providing a more competitive tax rate for those businesses looking to operate in our state,” said Sprinkle in a statement.</p>
<p>There are currently six states that have legalized online gambling: Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Michigan.</p>
