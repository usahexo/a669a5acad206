The new casino is a $375 million development that will include a 250-room hotel, a 30,000 square-foot casino, and multiple restaurants.

Renderings of the property show a lushly landscaped facility with cascading waterfalls and an ancient Indian temple facade.

JungleRaja will be the sixth casino on the Atlantic City boardwalk.

#  Casino developers are one step closer to bringing the JungleRaja to the boardwalk!

The proposed $450 million casino and entertainment complex, first announced in 2016, has seen several delays but is now one step closer to becoming a reality.

The project, which would include a hotel, retail space, and a gaming floor with 1,000 slot machines and 60 table games, was approved by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission last week.

The developers still need to secure financing for the project, but if all goes according to plan, construction could begin as early as this summer.

Once completed, the JungleRaja would be the largest casino in Atlantic City, surpassing both the Borgata and Harrah's Resort.

Supporters of the JungleRaja say that it will bring much-needed jobs and economic development to the city.

Opponents argue that the casino will cause traffic congestion and negatively impact local businesses.
