#  What are some things to avoid when playing the Buffalo Bills position machines?

Buffalo Bills position machines come in all shapes and sizes, making it easy to find the right one for your home. Before you buy a machine, however, there are some things you should be aware of to avoid buying a lemon.

The first thing to avoid is buying a used machine. Unless you know the person selling the machine and they can guaranteeing its quality, you're taking a risk by buying it. Machines that have been used are often abused and may not work properly.

You should also avoid machines that are too big or too small for your space. If the machine is too big, it will take up too much space in your home and be difficult to move around. If the machine is too small, you may quickly become bored of it.

Another thing to avoid is spending too much money on a machine. There are many great machines available for under $1,000, so don't overspend on something that you may not use often.

Finally, avoid machines that have complex controls or require a lot of maintenance. These machines can be frustrating to use and can take up time that you could be using to play games.
