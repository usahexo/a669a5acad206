#  YouTuber Shows How Numerous Different 5 Card Hands Will Be Possible In Poker Games!

In a recent YouTube video, popular poker YouTuber TonkasLaw shows how there are numerous different 5 card hands that can be possible in any given poker game. In the video, TonkasLaw lays out five different poker hands and goes through how each one would be played.

The first hand is two pairs, with two aces and two kings. In this instance, TonkasLaw recommends betting big preflop in order to scare off any potential opponents. He also suggests continuation betting if the flop comes with two low cards or if there is already a bet on the table. If the turn or river bring good cards for your hand, then go all-in!

For the next hand, TonkasLaw shows a flush draw. This means that your hand consists of five cards of the same suit. In this situation, he recommends calling a large preflop bet in order to see more cards. If you hit your flush on the flop, then be prepared to bet big! However, if you don’t hit your flush on the flop, then it might be best to fold.

Next up is a full house, which is three of a kind plus one pair. For this hand, TonkasLaw recommends raising preflop in order to build the pot. If you hit your full house on the flop, then bet big and try to take down the entire pot! However, if you don’t hit your full house on the flop, then it might be best to fold.

The fourth hand is three of a kind. For this hand, TonkasLaw recommends raising preflop in order to build the pot. If you hit your three of a kind on the flop, then bet big and try to take down the entire pot! However, if you don’t hit your three of a kind on the flop, then it might be best to fold.

Last but not least is two pair hands with Kings and Tens being two of those pairs. For this particular hand type TonkasLaw recommends slowplaying during early stages of play and trying not too reveal too much information about your hand. If someone else bets big during later stages of play however – go all in!

#  You Won't Believe How Many Different Ways You Can Win In A Poker Game!

There are so many different ways to win in a poker game, it can be hard to keep track! Here's a rundown of some of the most common ways to come out on top:

# Winning With The Best Hand

The most obvious way to win at poker is by having the best hand. If you're dealt a royal flush, for example, you're pretty much guaranteed to win the hand. Other hands, like a full house or quads, can also give you a big advantage over your opponents.

If you're not dealt the best hand, however, that doesn't mean you can't still win. There are plenty of other strategies you can use to make up for a weaker hand.

# Bluffing To Win

One of the most common strategies for winning when you don't have the best hand is bluffing. Bluffing is when you make a bet or raise even though you don't have a good hand, in an attempt to deceive your opponents into thinking that you do. If they folds because they think you're winning, then you automatically win the pot!

Keep in mind that bluffing is a risky strategy and it's not always guaranteed to work. You'll need to be able to read your opponents' reactions accurately in order to pull it off successfully.

# Making Use Of Odds And Outs

Another key factor in winning at poker is understanding odds and outs. Odds are basically how likely it is that you'll hit your desired card on the turn or river in order to win the hand. Outs are the number of cards left in the deck that could help improve your hand. By understanding these concepts, you can make better decisions about when to bet and raise, which can give you an edge over your opponents.

#  Check Out These Incredible Poker Moves Guaranteed To Win You The Game!

There are some poker moves that are just too good not to use, regardless of the game situation. If you're looking to up your poker game and start winning more hands, then check out these incredible moves guaranteed to help you take down the pot!

The Float

One of the most basic and yet effective poker moves is the float. When you float, you bet or raise with a hand that isn't strong enough to call or fold, but still has a chance of improving on the next card. For example, if you have two hearts in your hand and the flop comes with three hearts, you can float your opponent by betting or raising with the hope of hitting another heart on the turn or river.

The Squeeze Play

The squeeze play is a move that's employed when there's a lot of money in the pot and one or more players have already put in money. The idea is to bet enough so that your opponents all fold, leaving you with the pot all to yourself. Keep in mind though that this move can be very risky, so make sure you have a strong hand before attempting it!

The Dead Man's Hand

The dead man's hand is a legendary poker move made famous by Wild Bill Hickok. The hand consists of two pair - black aces and eights - hence its other name, "aces and eights". While this hand may not be as strong as some others, it's still capable of taking down a pot if played correctly. So if you're looking for an edge over your opponents, consider adding the dead man's hand to your repertoire!

When it comes to poker, the number of different hands you can be dealt is seemingly endless. In fact, with just five cards there are more than two million different combinations that can be made! While some of these hands are obviously better than others, there are still plenty of ways you can come out on top. Here are some of the most common winning hands in poker, ranked from highest to lowest.

# Royal Flush

A royal flush is the best hand you can possibly be dealt in poker, and it’s made up of ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. This hand is unbeatable, so if you’re fortunate enough to get dealt one you’re sure to win the game!

# Straight Flush

A straight flush is a hand that contains five consecutive cards all of the same suit. This hand is second only to a royal flush, so if you happen to get dealt one make sure to bet big!

# Four Of A Kind

This hand consists of four cards of the same rank and any other card. Four of a kind is a very strong hand and will usually win against any two other cards.

A full house is a hand that contains three cards of the same rank and two cards of another rank. This hand is very strong and often beats two pairs or a straight.
