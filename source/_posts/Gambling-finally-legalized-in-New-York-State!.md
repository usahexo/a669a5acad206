#  Gambling finally legalized in New York State!

After much anticipation and several failed attempts, the New York State Assembly finally passed a bill legalizing gambling on Monday, July 9th. The move is seen as a way to bring in much-needed revenue to the state, which has been struggling financially in recent years.

Under the new law, casinos will be allowed to open up in up to seven different locations around the state, with resorts also being permitted in certain areas. There will be a 10 percent tax on gaming revenue, with half of that money going towards education and the other half towards helping homeowners who are facing foreclosure.

Governor Andrew Cuomo praised the vote, calling it “a major victory for New York State.” He went on to say that the new law would create thousands of jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy.

Opposition to the bill was vocal but ultimately unsuccessful. Some lawmakers argued that gambling is a regressive form of taxation that takes money away from those who can least afford it. Others expressed concerns about increased crime and social ills that could come with legalized gambling.

In the end, however, those voices were drowned out by those in favor of passage, including many casino interests who have been eager to get into the New York market.

The first casinos are expected to open their doors by early 2020.

#  Historic day as New York becomes 4th state to legalize gambling

On Tuesday, the New York State Gaming Commission voted in favor of legalizing gambling in the state, making it the fourth to do so after Nevada, Delaware and Connecticut. The commission's vote was unanimous, with four commissioners voting in favor and one abstaining.

The measure will now go before the state legislature, which is expected to pass it. Governor Andrew Cuomo has said he would sign the bill into law.

"It is an historic day for the state of New York," Gaming Commission Chairman Kevin O'Neill said after Tuesday's vote. "This is a huge step forward for the gaming industry in New York."

Legalizing gambling in the state has been seen as a way to help revive upstate New York's struggling economy. Casino operators have said they would invest billions of dollars in developing new resorts upstate if gambling is legalized.

Gambling opponents say that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. But supporters say that it can also be a source of revenue for the state and create jobs.

#  Countdown to casinos: Legalized gambling just weeks away in New York

After years of debate and discussion, legalized gambling is just weeks away in New York. The State legislature has passed a bill that would allow for 10 upstate casinos and will Governor Andrew Cuomo sign it into law?

The momentum behind legalizing casinos has been building for years. Proponents argue that gambling will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state. However, opponents argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to social problems.

Cuomo has not said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is thought to be supportive of it. If the bill becomes law, the first casinos could open as soon as next year.

The specific details of the bill are still being worked out, but it is expected that there will be 10 upstate casinos. These casinos would be divided into three regions: the Southern Tier, the Capital Region, and the Catskills/Hudson Valley.

There would also be a limited number of licenses available for so-called “racinos” – racetracks with casino gambling. These licenses would be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

The exact locations of the new casinos have not been decided yet, but proposals are already coming in from all over the state. Some of the proposed locations include Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady, and Buffalo.

Casino gambling is currently legal in only three states – Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. However, several other states are considering legalizing casinos in order to boost their economies.

#  Gambling on track to be legalized in New York by early 2019

According to a recent report from <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/12/10/gambling-on-track-to-be-legalized-in-new-york-byearly-2019-1138131">Politico</a>, gambling is on track to be legalized in New York by early 2019. This would make New York the fourth state in the country to legalize online casino gambling, following New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.

Opponents of legalized gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems, but supporters say that it can be a source of revenue for the state. In New York, lawmakers are currently debating which types of gambling should be legalized.

Casino gambling is expected to be legalized, but there is some debate over whether or not sports betting should also be allowed. Some lawmakers believe that sports betting could pose a risk to the integrity of sporting events, while others say that it could bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the state.

The legalization of gambling in New York is likely to have a significant impact on the gaming industry. Major casino operators such as <a href="https://www.thewageringbusiness.com/cardinal-gaming-applebee%E2%80%99s-owner-takes-stake-delaware%E2%80%99s-tavernhospitality">Cardinal Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/article/shouldntyoubetonitnowheresbetterthannycforgambling20181128">TABCorp</a> have already expressed interest in expanding their operations into the state if gambling is legalized.

It will be interesting to see how the legalization of gambling plays out in New York and what effect it has on the gaming industry.

#  New York inches closer to legalizing gambling as bill clears key committee

The New York State Senate Finance Committee has cleared a bill that would legalize gambling in the state. The proposed legislation would allow for up to seven commercial casinos and one Native American casino to be constructed in the state.

The move is seen as a key step in getting the legislation passed, with committee chairman John DeFrancisco commenting that he believes there is enough support for the measure to pass both the Senate and Assembly.

The bill was initially proposed by Governor Andrew Cuomo in his 2019 budget proposal, and would provide a much needed boost to the state's coffers. The administration estimates that the gambling industry could generate up to $1.5 billion in new revenue for the state each year.

Some opponents of the measure have raised concerns about increased addiction and social costs, but proponents argue that such issues already exist with regards to current forms of gambling in the state. They also point out that the legislation would include strong regulation and consumer protections.

If passed, New York would join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of gambling in recent years. Gambling revenue has been on the rise across the country, with it reaching a record $42 billion last year.
