#  Indian Reservation Casino Chief Can Tell Which Tribe You Arrived From

An Indian reservation casino chief can tell which tribe you arrived from by the way you dress, according to a new study.

The study, published in the Journal of Ethnic and Racial Studies, found that people from different tribes tend to dress differently. For example, the study found that people from the Navajo tribe tend to dress more modestly than those from the Sioux tribe.

Reservation casino chiefs are able to distinguish between different tribes based on their clothing, hairstyles, and other cultural markers. This is important for casino chiefs because they need to be able to identify tribal members in order to give them preferential treatment.

The study found that casino chiefs often give preferential treatment to tribal members who are considered “high rollers.” This means that they give these tribal members larger bonuses, free rooms, and other perks.

The study also found that casino chiefs often look down on tribal members who are not considered “high rollers.” This can lead to tension between different tribes and can create conflict at casinos.

The study’s authors say that reservation casino chiefs need to be more aware of the way they treat different tribes. They say that casino chiefs should make sure that everyone is treated equally, regardless of their tribe.

#  Native American Casino Chief Can Guess Your Tribe

A Navajo chief who presides over a casino in northeast Arizona says he can often tell which tribe someone belongs to by their looks.

Chief Avin Werito of the Twin Arrows Navajo Resort and Casino said he can usually guess a person's tribe based on their "looks and mannerisms."

"Most of the time, I'm dead-on," Werito told The Associated Press in a recent interview.

The chief says one giveaway is whether someone has a "flat nose," which is common among some tribes but not all. He also looks for "clothing or jewelry styles" that are specific to certain tribes.

Werito grew up on the Navajo Nation and has worked in the casino industry for more than two decades. He was named chief of the Twin Arrows Navajo Resort and Casino last year.
