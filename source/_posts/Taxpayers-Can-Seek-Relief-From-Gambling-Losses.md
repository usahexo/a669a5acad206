#  Taxpayers Can Seek Relief From Gambling Losses

In the past, taxpayers who experienced losses from their gambling activities were not able to deduct these losses on their tax returns. This changed in 2018 with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Taxpayers are now able to deduct their gambling losses up to the amount of their gambling winnings for the year.

There are a few things that taxpayers need to keep in mind when claiming these deductions. The first is that the losses must be itemized on Schedule A. Gambling winnings do not need to be reported on this form, as they are already reported on Form 1040, Line 21. In order to claim the deduction, taxpayers must also have maintained accurate records of their gambling winnings and losses. This includes receipts, statements, and other documentation of the gambling activity.

There are some restrictions on who can claim this deduction. For example, it is not available to those who are considered professional gamblers. Additionally, certain types of gambling activities are not eligible for the deduction, such as horse racing and casino games such as blackjack or roulette.

Taxpayers who have questions about whether they qualify for this deduction or how to claim it should consult with a tax professional.

#  Don't Let Gambling lossES Sabotage Your Tax Return 

Gambling losses can really put a damper on your tax return. Consider the following:

1) Gambling losses reduce the amount of taxable income you have. This means that you can end up paying less tax on your winnings.

2) You can deduct your gambling losses from your winnings when filing your taxes. This will help to lower your taxable income, and may even result in a refund.

3) You must itemize your deductions in order to claim your gambling losses. This means that you will need to keep careful track of all of your gambling-related expenses throughout the year.

4) If you have net losses from gambling, you may be able to carry them over to future years. This can help to offset any taxable income you may earn during those years.

It is important to keep in mind that you can only claim gambling losses if you itemize your deductions. If you choose the standard deduction, then you cannot claim gambling losses. Be sure to track all of your expenses related to gambling, such as transportation, lodging, and food. This will make it easier for you when it comes time to file your taxes.

#  Get Your Gambling Losses in Order For Tax Season 

If you're one of the many Americans who gamble, there's a good chance you incurred some losses during 2017. Now that tax season is upon us, it's time to get your gambling losses in order so you can claim them on your return.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses from their winnings, as long as they itemize their deductions. This can be helpful in lowering your taxable income and potentially reducing your tax bill.

However, it's important to note that you can only deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you won $2000 but lost $2500, you can only deduct $2000 worth of losses.

If you're not sure how to document your gambling losses, the IRS has a few guidelines:

- Keep track of the amount of money you lose and win over the course of the year. Be sure to include any winnings from lotteries, raffles, or sweepstakes in addition to traditional casino games.
- Save all documentation related to your gambling activities, such as receipts, tickets, statements, etc. 
- Make sure to report all of your gambling income and losses on Schedule C (or Schedule F if you're self-employed). 

If you have any questions about how to claim your gambling losses on your tax return, be sure to consult a tax professional.
