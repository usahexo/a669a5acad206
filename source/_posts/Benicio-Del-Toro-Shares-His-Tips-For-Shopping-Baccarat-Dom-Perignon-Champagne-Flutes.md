#  Benicio Del Toro Shares His Tips For Shopping Baccarat Dom Perignon Champagne Flutes

A recent interview by Benicio Del Toro for Vanity Fair Magazine covered a wide range of topics. One aspect discussed was how the actor approaches shopping for Baccarat Dom Perignon champagne flutes.

Del Toro revealed that he always looks for the best bargains. "You have to look for the deals," he said. "I mean, I'm not going to spend, like, $10,000 on a set of champagne flutes, but if I can find something that's beautiful and elegant and maybe costs $2,000 or $3,000, I'll go for it."

The actor also shared some helpful tips on how to select the right champagne flutes for your needs. "First of all, you have to think about what you're going to be using them for," he said. "If you're only going to be using them for special occasions, then you might want something a little more elegant. But if you're going to be using them every day, then you might want something a little more casual."

In addition, Del Toro advised considering the size and shape of the flutes. "Some people might prefer taller flutes because they think it makes the champagne taste better," he said. "But I actually prefer shorter and wider ones because they're easier to drink from."

Ultimately, the actor stressed the importance of finding a pair of champagne flutes that make you feel comfortable. "The most important thing is that you feel good about them," he said. "They should reflect your personality and make you happy every time you use them."
