#  7stars Casino Operator Addresses Gambling Addiction

This week, the 7stars Casino operator spoke out about the rising problem of gambling addiction. The company’s CEO, George Town, believes that gambling addiction is a serious issue that requires more attention from both the industry and governments.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Town said that the industry has been “complacent” in addressing the problem of gambling addiction. He also urged governments to do more to help those affected by gambling addiction.

Earlier this year, the UK’s Gambling Commission released a report on gambling addiction. The report found that around 2 million people in Britain are affected by problem gambling. The study also found that the number of people with a gambling addiction is increasing each year.

Problem gambling can have a serious impact on individuals and families. It can cause financial problems, relationship issues, and even lead to suicide.

The 7stars Casino operator has launched a campaign to address the problem of gambling addiction. The campaign includes a website where people can find information on how to get help for a gambling addiction. The website also offers support and advice for family members and friends of people with a gambling addiction.

Town believes that it is important for the industry to work together to address the problem of gambling addiction. He says that it is crucial for casinos to provide customers with information on how to gamble responsibly. And he urges governments to do more to help those affected by problem gambling.

#  7stars Casino Operator Aids Those Affected By Gambling Addiction

The operator of the 7stars Casino has announced that it will be donating a percentage of its profits to organisations that help those affected by gambling addiction. The move follows criticism from some quarters that the casino is contributing to gambling addiction rates in the country.

In a statement, the casino said that it is committed to helping those affected by gambling addiction and pledged to donate 1% of its profits each year to organisations that provide help and support for those with the condition. The donation will be made annually and will be used to support research into gambling addiction and to provide help and treatment for those affected.

A spokesperson for the casino said that the decision had been made in light of recent criticism butthat the casino has always been committedto helping those with gambling addiction. “We are proud to be able tosupport organisations that help people dealing with this issue,” she said.

7stars Casino is one of the largest operators in the country and has come under fire in recent months for allegedly contributingto gambling addiction rates. The donation is seen as a way of deflecting some of that criticism and showing that the casino iscommittedto responsible gaming.

The donation comes as concerns about gambling addiction continue to mount. Last year,the government released a report which showed that there were over 246,000 problem gamblers in Britain. That’s an increase of almost 20% from 2008 figures. Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both individuals and their families and can leadto financial problems, depression, and even suicide.

Organisations which provide help and treatment for problem gamblers are seeing an increase in demand for their servicesand are in need of funding to meet that demand. The donation from 7stars Casino will go a long way towards meeting that need.

#  7stars Casino Operator Provides Resources For Gamble Addicts

7stars Casino, an online gambling operator, wants to provide the best possible experience for their clients. This means that they are always looking for ways to improve their platform and services. In light of this, the company has decided to provide resources for those struggling with gambling addiction.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have severe consequences for the addict and their loved ones. It is estimated that around 2 percent of the world’s population suffers from some form of gambling addiction. This means that there are millions of people who need help and support to overcome their addiction.

7stars Casino is determined to do its part in providing assistance to these individuals. The company has set up a special page on its website where addicts can find information and resources about gambling addiction. This includes articles about how to recognise the symptoms of gambling addiction, how to get help, and where to find support groups.

The website also provides a list of helplines and support groups that addicts can contact for help. 7stars Casino recognises that it cannot provide all the help that these individuals need but hopes that by providing this information, it can at least point them in the right direction.

The company also plans to work closely with GambleAware, a UK-based charity that aims to reduce gambling-related harm. GambleAware provides information and resources about responsible gambling and offers free counseling and support services for addicts and their families.

7stars Casino is committed to helping those affected by gambling addiction and looks forward to working with GambleAware to provide much-needed assistance and support.
