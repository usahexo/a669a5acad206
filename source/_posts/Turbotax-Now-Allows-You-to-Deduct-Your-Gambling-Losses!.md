#  Turbotax Now Allows You to Deduct Your Gambling Losses!

For tax years 2018 and 2019, theTurboTax software will allow you to deduct your gambling losses! This is great news for anyone who likes to gamble, as it can help to offset any gambling income that you may have. In order to qualify for this deduction, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return.

To claim your gambling losses, you will need to report the amount of your winnings and losses separately. You can do this by keeping track of your winnings and losses each day, or by keeping track of your total winnings and losses for the year. When you file your taxes, you will simply need to report the total amount of your gambling losses.

Keep in mind that there are some restrictions on how much you can deduct in regards to your gambling losses. For example, you can only deduct up to the amount of your gambling income for the year. So if you had $1,000 in gambling income for the year, you can only deduct up to $1,000 in gambling losses. Additionally, you cannot claim a loss if it is greater than your winnings for the year.

One thing to keep in mind is that not all gambling activities are considered equal for tax purposes. The types of activities that can be deducted include: betting on races, playing poker, wagering on cards or dice games, playing slot machines or bingo, and buying lottery tickets. However, other types of gambling such as casino games (blackjack, roulette, etc.), betting on sports outcomes, or investing in margin stock market transactions are not deductible.

If you have questions about how to claim your gambling losses on TurboTax or whether or not a particular activity qualifies as a deduction, be sure to check with a tax professional.

#  Get Your Taxes Done Right and Deduct Your Gambling Losses

Taxes are always a hot topic, especially since they can be complex and vary based on your specific situation. Here we’re going to focus on how you can deduct your gambling losses in order to reduce your taxable income.

But before we get into the nitty gritty details, let’s first cover some basics about gambling and taxes.

Gambling is considered taxable income in the United States if you earn more than $600 from it in a year. However, you can also deduct your gambling losses from your taxable income. This can be a great way to lower your tax bill and keep more of your hard-earned money.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind when claiming gambling losses as a deduction. First, you can only deduct losses that exceed the amount of winnings you report on your tax return. In other words, you can’t claim a loss if it’s less than what you won.

Second, you need to be able to document your losses. This means keeping track of how much money you lost and receipts or statements for any wagers or casino visits. If you don’t have this documentation, the IRS may not allow you to claim the deduction.

Finally, gambling losses are only deductible up to the amount of your winnings. So if you have $5,000 in winnings and $7,000 in losses for the year, you can only deduct $5,000 of those losses on your tax return. The remaining $2,000 is lost forever (well, at least until you have another winning year).

Now that we’ve gone over the basics, let’s dive into how to actually claim your gambling losses as a deduction on your tax return. The process isn’t too complicated but it’s important to follow all the steps so that the IRS doesn’t come knocking on your door later.

The first step is to figure out exactly how much money you lost from gambling last year. You can do this by adding up all of your losing wagers or casino visits and then subtracting that total from any wins that you reported on your tax return. This will give you your net gambling loss for the year.

Next, report this amount on Line 28 of Schedule A (Form 1040), which is where deductions for miscellaneous expenses are reported. Be sure to include documentation such as receipts or statements with your tax return so that the IRS can verify that the information is correct. You may also want to write “Gambling Losses” next to Line 28 so that it’s easy to identify when looking at your return.

That’s all there is to it! By claiming your gambling losses as a deduction on Schedule A, you can save yourself some money on taxes and keep more of what you earned last year. Just be sure to follow all of the steps carefully and keep good records so that there are no problems down the road

#  Don't Let Gambling Addiction Cost You More Than It Has to

Gambling addiction can be a costly habit. It can cost you in terms of both your finances and your relationships. The good news is that you don't have to let gambling addiction cost you more than it has to. Here are four tips to help you keep gambling addiction from costing you too much:

1. Set limits on how much money you're willing to gamble each day or week.

When you're struggling with gambling addiction, it can be easy to lose track of how much money you're spending. Setting limits on how much money you're willing to gamble each day or week can help counteract this.

2. Keep track of the money you spend on gambling.

This goes hand in hand with setting limits on how much money you gambles each day or week. Keeping track of the money you spend on gambling will help you stay within your budget and avoid overspending.

3. Make a plan for what you will do with the money if you win.

This may seem like an odd tip, but it's important to have a plan for what you'll do with the money if you happen to win while gambling. This will help keep you from spending all of your winnings and then some.

4. Avoid places where gambling is prevalent.

If possible, try to avoid places where gambling is rampant. This will make it less likely that you'll give into temptation and start gambling again.

#  Tax Season Just Got a Little More Fun: Deduct Your Gambling Losses

It’s that time of year again. Time to gather up all of your tax documents and start filling out your return. This year, why not add a little bit of excitement by deducting your gambling losses?

Yes, you read that right. You can actually write off your gambling losses on your taxes. However, there are a few things you need to know before you claim this deduction.

First, the amount you can deduct is limited to the amount of gambling income you have reported on your return. So, if you lost $1,000 at the casino but only made $500 in gambling profits, you can only deduct $500 of your losses.

Second, you can only claim this deduction if you itemize your deductions. So, if you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing, you cannot claim your gambling losses.

Third, the deduction is only available for personal gambling activities. You cannot claim losses from gambling activities carried out in a professional capacity.

Fourth, the IRS requires taxpayers to keep detailed records of their gambling activities. This includes information such as the date and amount of each bet, as well as any winnings or losses. So, be sure to keep good records throughout the year!

If you meet all of these requirements, then it’s time to start claiming those losses on your taxes! Just be sure to speak with a tax professional beforehand to make sure you’re doing everything correctly.
