#  What Jail Would They Take Me To If I Was Initially Arrested at WinStar Casino?

WinStar Casino is an amazing place to visit, filled with plenty of gaming and entertainment options. However, if you find yourself in trouble with the law while on the premises, you may be wondering what jail they would take me to.

The short answer is that it depends on the severity of your crime and which jurisdiction you are in. Generally speaking, local law enforcement will handle crimes that occur within their municipality, while state or federal law enforcement will handle crimes that occur on casino property but fall outside the boundaries of any specific municipality.

For misdemeanor crimes, such as simple assault or petty theft, you would likely be taken to the local county jail. If you are arrested for a felony crime, such as armed robbery or homicide, you would likely be transferred to a state or federal facility.

In either case, it is important to contact a criminal defense attorney as soon as possible. An experienced lawyer can help advise you of your rights and work to build a strong defense on your behalf.

For example, in Pennsylvania, misdemeanors can result in fines of up to $2,500, while felonies can result in fines of up to $25,000.

It is important to note that being arrested at a casino does not mean that you will automatically be convicted of a crime. You have the right to remain silent and to consult with an attorney before deciding whether or not to answer any questions posed by law enforcement officials.
