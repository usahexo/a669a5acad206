#  What are the best five cards in poker?

There are many different variations of poker, but some cards are consistently better than others. Here are the five best cards in poker, based on their versatility and power.

1. The ace. The ace is the best card in poker for a number of reasons. It can be used as either the highest or lowest card in a hand, and it is also the most valuable card in the deck. This makes it an ideal card for any situation.

2. The king. Like the ace, the king is a versatile card that can be used in a number of different ways. It is also one of the most powerful cards in the deck, making it a popular choice for many players.

3. The queen. Just like the king, the queen is a versatile and powerful card that can be used in a number of ways. She is especially valuable when paired with another queen or king, making her a formidable opponent at the table.

4. The jack. The jack is not quite as versatile as some of the other cards on this list, but it is still a very powerful card that can be useful in a number of situations. And thanks to its low rank, it can often be used to bluff your opponents into thinking you have a weak hand.

5. The 10s. While not as powerful as some of the other cards on this list, the 10s are still valuable because they represent two pairs when combined with another 10s card. This gives you a lot of options when playing poker, making them a good choice for any situation."

#  What is the rank of a full house?

A full house is a poker hand that contains three of a kind and a pair. It ranks above two pair but below a four of a kind.

#  How do you make a flush in poker?

Making a flush in poker is a very satisfying feeling.

There are a few different ways to make a flush, but the most common way is by having five cards of the same suit in your hand. If you have four cards of the same suit, and one card that doesn't match, that's called a "flush draw."

If you're playing in a casino, and someone else has already made a flush, the best you can do is "one pair." That means you have two cards of the same rank in your hand.

To make a flush in poker, you need to put all of your cards on the table. Once you've done that, the other players can either fold (leave) or keep playing. If they keep playing, then the next step is to put out another card. The player who has the highest-ranked card of the same suit as the five on the table wins. If there's more than one player with a high card of the same suit, then the player with the second-highest ranked card wins. And so on...

Here's an example: let's say you have an Ace of Spades, two Kings of Clubs, and three sixes of diamonds. The Ace of Spades is high-ranked, so if there are any other Aces or Spades on the table, you win. If there are no other Aces or Spades on the table, then the Kings of Clubs would be high-ranked and you would win. If there are no other Kings or Clubs on the table, then the sixes of diamonds would be high-ranked and you would win.
