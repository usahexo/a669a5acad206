#  Atlantic City Casino Closures Continue as Trump Plaza Shuts Down

After a long and contentious bankruptcy battle, the Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City finally shut down on September 16, 2014. The closure of the casino leaves only 8 casinos operating in the city, far fewer than the 12 that were open just a few years ago.

The closure of the Trump Plaza is another blow to Atlantic City's struggling economy, which has been battered by competition from casinos in neighboring states. The bankruptcy of Revel Casino earlier this year also contributed to the city's economic woes.

Atlantic City officials are hoping that the opening of the new $2.6 billion Revel casino will help revive the city's tourism industry. But with casinos closing at a rate of more than one per year, it remains to be seen whether Revel will be able to turn things around.

The Trump Plaza closure is also a potential headache for Donald Trump, who was an owner of the casino until 2009. Trump has been trying to distance himself from his casino businesses in light of his political aspirations, but the closures could give his opponents ammunition to attack him as being responsible for Atlantic City's troubles.

#  Atlantic City Casino Closures Reach All-Time High with the Shutting Down of Trump Plaza

The Atlantic City casino closures have reached a new all-time high with the shutting down of Trump Plaza. This closure makes the total number of casinos in Atlantic City to eight, down from twelve in 2014. This is just another hit for an industry that has been struggling for years.

The main reason given for the closure of Trump Plaza was that it was no longer profitable. This follows the closure of Revel Casino earlier this year, which left Atlantic City with only seven casinos. Trump Plaza will shut its doors on September 16, 2014.

Atlantic City has been fighting hard to keep its casinos open, but with gaming revenues declining every year, it has become increasingly difficult. The casino closures are a major blow to the city’s economy, as they provide jobs and tax revenue.

Atlantic City is not alone in its struggle to keep casinos open. In fact, the entire gambling industry is facing difficult times. This is due to competition from other states and countries, as well as the growth of online gambling.

Revel Casino was one of the most recent casualties of the struggling gambling industry. The $2 billion casino resort shut down in February 2014 after just over two years in operation. The closure left 3,000 employees without a job.

In March 2014, Caesars Entertainment announced that it would be closing its Showboat Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. This would leave the city with only six casinos. Caesars cited pressure from competition as one of the reasons for the closure.

The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel closed its doors in January 2014, leaving 1,600 employees without a job. This casino had been in operation since 1978 and was once considered one of Atlantic City’s most successful casinos.

In December 2013, the Atlantic Club was sold to Philadelphia poker company Garden State Gaming for just $15 million. At the time of its closure, it was the first U.S.-based casino to close since President Obama took office in 2009.

#  5th Atlantic City Casino Closes its Doors as Revel Struggles to Remain Open

Atlantic City, long known as the gambling capital of the east coast, is now seeing its 5th casino close its doors in the last two years. The Revel Casino Hotel, which onlyopened in April of 2012, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is currently up for sale.

The Revel Casino Hotel was built at a cost of $2.4 billion and was intended to revive Atlantic City's struggling casino industry. However, due to competition from casinos in neighboring states such as Pennsylvania and New York, the Revel Casino Hotel has failed to turn a profit.

In addition to competition from other casinos, the Revel Casino Hotel has also been hurt by the slow economy and Hurricane Sandy. The hotel closed its doors for two months last year due to damage from the hurricane.

Revel is not the only casino in Atlantic City to file for bankruptcy in recent years. The Showboat, Trump Plaza, and Atlantic Club have all filed for bankruptcy in the past two years.

#  Atlantic City Casinos Continue to Close as the Revenue Numbers Decline

Atlantic City has been on quite a decline in recent years. The closure of casinos is only worsening the revenue numbers for the city, as people are now choosing to gamble elsewhere.

The most recent casualty was the Trump Taj Mahal, which closed its doors in October of 2016. This left only 8 casinos remaining in Atlantic City, and it doesn't seem like this number is going to increase any time soon.

Revenue numbers have been steadily declining for years now, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. In fact, things are only getting worse as time goes on. Atlantic City's casino industry has declined by over $2 billion since 2006.

This is largely due to competition from other states, such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. These states have begun offering gambling opportunities that are much more lucrative than what Atlantic City can offer.

This has caused a lot of casinos to close down in Atlantic City, and there doesn't seem to be much hope for the city's future. The revenue numbers continue to decline, and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it.

#  Atlantic City's Casino Closure Epidemic Continues with the Shutting Down of Trump Plaza

The Atlantic City casino closure epidemic has continued with the recent shutting down of the Trump Plaza hotel and casino. This marks the fifth casino in Atlantic City to close in 2014, leaving only 8 casinos remaining in operation.

The Atlantic Club, The Showboat, Revel, and The Trump Plaza have all closed this year, leaving thousands of employees out of work. The casino closures are due to a number of factors including competition from neighboring states, bad financial decisions by casino operators, and changing consumer habits.

Atlantic City was once a booming casino destination, but it has been struggling in recent years as gambling has become more popular in other states. In 2006, there were 12 casinos in operation in Atlantic City, but that number has steadily decreased as the industry has struggled.

The closing of the Trump Plaza is another blow to the city's economy, and it is unclear if Atlantic City will be able to recover from this latest setback. Local officials are hopeful that new development projects currently underway will help revive the city's fortunes, but it remains to be seen if those projects will be enough to save Atlantic City's casinos.
