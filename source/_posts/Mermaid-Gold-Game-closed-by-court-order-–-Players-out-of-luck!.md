#  Mermaid Gold Game closed by court order – Players out of luck!

On July 3, 2019, the Korean District Court issued an order to close down the popular mobile game Mermaid Gold.

The game’s developer, Moonwhale, released a statement on their website stating that the game will be closed as of 11:59 PM on July 5th.

The reason for the closure is still unknown. However, many players are speculating that it might have something to do with Moonwhale’s recent acquisition by NCSOFT.

Since its release in October of 2018, Mermaid Gold has quickly become one of the most popular mobile games in Korea. In just 10 months, the game had amassed over 14 million downloads.

Many players are now left with unanswered questions and no way to recoup their losses. Some have even taken to social media to express their frustration and anger at the developer.

#  Mermaid Gold Game closed – Owner arrested on fraud charges

According to reports from the Mermaid Gold game development team, the game has been closed and its owner arrested on fraud charges.

The game, which launched in late 2017, was touted as a “fantasy adventure” featuring mermaids and other mythical creatures. However, it appears that the game was little more than a scam, with players unable to withdraw any of their funds.

In a statement released earlier this week, the development team said that they were “appalled and saddened” by the turn of events. They went on to say that they had been working with authorities to try and resolve the situation.

The owner of Mermaid Gold has not yet been identified, but is reported to be a Russian national. It is not yet clear what will happen to player funds.

#  Mermaid Gold Game shut down – $50,000 in player funds seized

Mermaid Gold, an online casino game that has taken the internet by storm, was shut down on Thursday by the United States Department of Justice. The game had been operating since July of last year, and had amassed a player base of over $50,000.

Players were stunned when they received an email from Mermaid Gold announcing the closure of the game. In the email, the company stated that “the operators of this site are not licensed to provide gaming services within the United States” and that all player funds were being seized by the DOJ.

The Mermaid Gold website is now offline, but players who had money in their accounts are still struggling to get their money back. One player, who asked to remain anonymous, told us that he had over $2,000 in his account when Mermaid Gold closed down.

“I’ve been trying to get in touch with customer support for weeks now, but no one is answering my emails or phone calls. I don’t know what to do – I can’t afford to lose that much money.”

This is not the first time that an online casino has closed down and seized player funds. In November of last year, Slotland Casino shut down its website and refused to pay out any of the $2.5 million it owed its players.

So what can you do if you have money in an online casino that suddenly shuts down? Unfortunately, there is not much you can do except hope that the company will eventually payout your winnings. You can try contacting customer support or the relevant gambling authority in your country, but there is no guarantee that you will get your money back.

The best thing you can do is to make sure you only play at casinos that are licensed and regulated by a reputable authority – this way you will be protected if something like this happens.

#  Police raid Mermaid Gold Game casino – Alleged illegal activities discovered

Police raided the Mermaid Gold Game casino in the early hours of Wednesday morning, after months of investigations into alleged illegal activities at the casino.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police Department’s Vice and Gambling Squad conducted the raid, during which they seized a large number of gaming machines, computer equipment and documents.

A statement from the MPD said that the raid was part of an ongoing investigation into allegations that the casino was being used for money laundering and other criminal activities.

No arrests have yet been made, but the MPD said that they are continuing to investigate and that more information will be released in due course.

This is not the first time that allegations of illegal activity have been made against Mermaid Gold Game casino. In March of this year, two men were arrested after police raided the casino and found evidence of unlawful gambling.

Casino owners insist that they are operating within the law and have denied any wrongdoing.

#  Casino closes its doors amid money laundering allegations

The much anticipated closure of the Lucky Dragon Casino in Las Vegas has finally occurred, amid allegations of money laundering. Just two years after it opened, the casino has shuttered its doors, leaving its employees out of work and its customers without a place to gamble.

The Lucky Dragon was unique among casinos in Las Vegas in that it catered specifically to Asian gamblers. It featured games that were popular in Asia, as well as a staff that spoke Mandarin and Cantonese. This may have been one of the reasons why the casino became the focus of a money laundering investigation.

Federal officials have not released many details about the investigation, other than to say that they are looking into possible links between the casino and organized crime syndicates in Asia. They have also not said whether anyone has been arrested or charged in connection with the case.

In a statement released shortly after the closure was announced, casino owner Dr. Hoi-Top Lam said that he was cooperating fully with authorities and hoped to reopen the casino as soon as possible. He also promised that all employees would be paid their full wages for the remainder of their contracts.

It is unclear what will happen to the Lucky Dragon now that it has closed its doors. There are rumors that Lam may try to sell it, but no deals have been announced yet.
