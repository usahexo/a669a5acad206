The Gold Strike Casino in Jean, Nevada is planning a major expansion that will include a new hotel and additional casino space. The project is expected to cost $100 million and will create 300 jobs.

The Gold Strike Casino is owned by MGM Resorts International, which also owns the Mirage, the Bellagio, and other casinos in Las Vegas. The company has not announced when construction on the expansion will begin.

The Gold Strike Casino's expansion is also good news for Jean, Nevada, which has been struggling economically since the closure of the nearby Excalibur Hotel and Casino in late 2013. The closure cost Jean over 1,000 jobs.
