#  How To Cheat Video Poker Machines and Win Every Time! 

Cheating video poker machines is easier than you think. All you need are a few simple tools and a basic understanding of how the machines work. In this article, I will teach you how to cheat and win every time!

The first step is to understand the basic principles of video poker. Video poker is a five card draw game. You are dealt five cards, and you have the option to keep any or all of them. You then draw new cards to replace the ones you discarded. The goal is to create the best possible hand using your five cards.

There are many different variations of video poker, but they all follow the same basic rules. The most common variation is Jacks or Better, which pays out if you get a pair of jacks or better. Other common variations include Double Bonus Poker and Deuces Wild, both of which pay out more for specific types of hands.

Now that you understand the basics of video poker, let's take a look at how to cheat and win every time!

The first thing you need is a deck of playing cards. Shuffle the deck and then fan it out face down on the table in front of you. Now place a small object such as a penny on top of the first card in the deck (the card with the penny on it is now your "marker card"). Do not let anyone else touch the deck from this point forward!

Now we're ready to start cheating! First, discard all but one of your cards (you can use any discard method you like - just make sure to leave one card). Next, turn over the marker card and find its mate (the card immediately following it in the deck). Remember this number - we'll call it A). Now turn over the next four cards (B through E) and find their mates (the cards immediately following them in the deck). Write these numbers down - they will be used later in the process.

Next, we're going to create our cheat sheet. This sheet will tell us which cards to keep and which ones to discard based on our initial hand and the numbers we just wrote down. To create your cheat sheet, simply write "KEEP" next to each number for the cards you want to keep, and write "DISCARD" next to each number for the cards you want to discard. Here's an example:

     KEEP  DISCARD 


If your initial hand is 2-3-4-5-6, then A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5, E=6. You would then write "KEEP" next to 2-3-4-5-6 on your cheat sheet, and "DISCARD" next to 7-8-9-10-J (since their mates are not in your initial hand).

Once you have created your cheat sheet, it's time to start cheating! Follow these steps:
1) Shuffle the deck and Fan it out face down on the table in front of you 
2) Place your marker card on top of the first card in the deck 
3) Discard all but one of your cards 
4) Turn over your marker card - this is now your starting card 
5) Find its mate (card immediately following it in deck) - lets call this number B 
6) Turn over 4 more cards - these will be our other 4 starting cards (C through E)    C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AA BB CC DD EE FF GG HH II JJ

7) Look up row A for each of your starting cards on your cheat sheet - these are Keep Cards 
8 ) Look up column B for eachofyourkeepplayers(A thru J)onyourcheatSheettheseareDiscardCards )

 If A = 2 & B = 3 , then discarding player 3 & 7 as they have no mates within hand

#  Learn The Secrets Of How To Cheat Video Poker Machines 

In the casino, when you play video poker, the house has a built-in advantage over the player. 
This is because video poker machines payout proportionately less than the amount of money put in them. For instance, if you were to bet a dollar on each hand of video poker, the machine would return about 97 cents on average. So, for every $100 you put in the machine, you can expect to get back about $97. This is why casinos make billions of dollars from video poker every year.
However, there are ways to cheat these machines and take home more of your hard-earned money!

The first way to cheat at video poker is to use a strategy known as “the optimal play”. This strategy takes into account the payouts of each type of hand and tells you what cards to hold and discard in order to maximize your chances of winning. You can find detailed information on how to use this strategy online or in books dedicated specifically to video poker strategies.
Another way to cheat at video poker is to use a cheating device known as a “video poker analyzer”. This device attaches to the underside of the machine and records all of the cards that are dealt. It then tells you what cards to hold and discard in order to win more often. There are a number of different models available on the market, so do your research before purchasing one.
Lastly, another way to cheat at video poker is to use a “card counting system”. This technique involves keeping track of which cards have been dealt and adjusting your betting patterns accordingly. By doing this, you can increase your chances of winning by up to 50%. 
Whichever method you choose, remember that cheating at video poker is illegal and can get you banned from casinos all over the world! So be sure to use caution and consult with experts before attempting any of these techniques!

#  How To Cheat Video Poker Machines And Stay Under The Radar 

If you're looking for a way to make some easy money, look no further than video poker machines. While most people think that the only way to win at video poker is by playing perfectly, with a little bit of cheating you can easily tilt the odds in your favor. In this article we'll go over two different methods of cheating at video poker: using a deck of cards and using a computer.

Using a Deck of Cards

One way to cheat at video poker is to use a deck of cards that are marked in some way to help you win. There are a few ways to do this, but one simple way is to take a permanent marker and mark the 4 Aces with an X. Then, when you're playing, if you see that the machine has given you an Ace, mentally note what rank it is (2, 3, 4, or 5). This will help you know when you have a winning hand.

Another way to use cards to cheat at video poker is by making sure that all of your high cards are different colors. For example, if all of your Kings are black, then when you see a black King on the screen you'll know that it's not one of your cards and you can stop betting.

Using a Computer

If you're looking for an even easier way to cheat at video poker, then using a computer might be for you. All you need is software that can track the odds of each hand and tell you when to bet and when to fold. One popular program for this is called "Poker Assassin". With programs like this it's easy to make money by knowing when the odds are in your favor.

#  How To Cheat Video Poker Machines & Stay Safe

Video poker is a game of chance and skill. The object of the game is to make the best possible five-card hand using any combination of the player’s two cards and the five community cards. In order to win, players must make the best possible hand using whatever combination of their cards they are dealt.

When playing video poker, it is important to understand that as with most casino games, there is a house edge. This means that over time, the casino will make more money than the players. The size of this edge varies from game to game, but it is always there. This is why it is important for players to learn as much about the game as possible before playing, in order to give themselves the best chance of winning.

One way to improve one's chances of winning at video poker is to know which hands beat which. For example, a royal flush - AKQJT - always beats four of a kind, while three of a kind always beats two pair. There are also certain hands that are ties, such as two pairs with identical rank or three of a kind with different ranks. In general, however, knowing which hands beat which will give players a better idea as to what they should be holding onto and what they should be discarding.

Another way to improve one's chances of winning at video poker is by using a strategy chart. Strategy charts can be found online or in books devoted solely to video poker strategy. These charts show players exactly what hands to hold onto and discard based on the particular version of video poker being played and the number of credits being wagered per hand. Following a strategy chart correctly gives players the best possible chance of winning at video poker.

Finally, when playing video poker it is important to keep track of how much money one is spending on each hand and to set limits for oneself in terms of how much money can be lost in any one sitting at the machine. This will help keep players from losing too much money and help ensure that gambling does not become an addiction or problem.
