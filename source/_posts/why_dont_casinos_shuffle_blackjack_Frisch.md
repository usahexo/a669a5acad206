# Why Don't Casinos Shuffle Blackjack: An Explanation by Frisch

Blackjack is a popular casino game that is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. It's a game that requires skill and strategy to win, and one of the most critical components of the game is the shuffle. But have you ever wondered why casinos don't shuffle blackjack after every hand? In this article, we will explain this phenomenon according to Frisch.

## The Importance of the Shuffle in Blackjack

In blackjack, the shuffle is essential because it ensures that the cards are randomized and that no one can predict the outcome of the game. The shuffle is critical in blackjack because the game relies heavily on the order of the cards. The order of the cards determines the odds of getting certain cards and influences the player's strategy.

## The Reason Why Casinos Don't Shuffle Blackjack

Contrary to popular belief, casinos don't shuffle blackjack after every hand for several reasons. One of the most important reasons is that it slows down the game. Shuffling the cards after every hand takes time and can make the game tedious, especially for players who want to play quickly.

Another reason why casinos don't shuffle blackjack after every hand is that it increases the house edge. The house edge is the casino's advantage over the player, and it's a percentage of the player's bet that the casino expects to win over the long term. When the casino shuffles the cards after every hand, it reduces the number of cards in play, making it more difficult for the player to win. This increases the house edge and ensures that the casino makes more money.

## How Often Do Casinos Shuffle Blackjack?

Casinos have different policies when it comes to shuffling blackjack. Some casinos shuffle after every hand, while others shuffle after a specific number of hands. Most casinos use a "shoe" to hold the cards in blackjack. A shoe is a device that holds several decks of cards and allows the dealer to deal multiple hands without shuffling. The number of decks in the shoe varies depending on the casino, but it's typically between 4 and 8 decks.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the shuffle is a critical component of blackjack, but casinos don't shuffle after every hand. They do this to keep the game moving quickly and to increase the house edge. Most casinos use a shoe to hold the cards and shuffle after a specific number of hands. As a player, it's important to understand the casino's policies regarding shuffling to adjust your strategy accordingly.
