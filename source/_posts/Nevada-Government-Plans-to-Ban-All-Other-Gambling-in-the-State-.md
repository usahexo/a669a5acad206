#  Nevada Government Plans to Ban All Other Gambling in the State 

In a move that has surprised many in the gaming industry, the Nevada government announced plans to ban all other forms of gambling in the state. This includes casinos, horse racing, and even lotteries.

Governor Brian Sandoval released a statement saying that the ban is necessary to protect the state's revenue from gaming taxes. He believes that without this ban, the state's gaming revenue would be significantly reduced.

This announcement has been met with mixed reactions. Some people support the ban, while others believe that it will hurt the state's economy. Several casino owners have already spoken out against the plan, saying that it will lead to job losses and decreased revenue for the state.

Some analysts believe that this ban could be a sign of things to come in the gambling industry. With online gambling becoming increasingly popular, they believe that more states may begin to restrict or even ban traditional forms of gambling.

#  Gambling Officials Say Slot Machines Provide More Consistent Revenue 

The gambling officials in the state of <state> say that slot machines provide more consistent revenue than other gambling games.

One official said, "Slot machines are the bread and butter of our industry. They provide a more consistent stream of revenue than any other game."

This statement is based on the fact that slot machines payout more often than other games. In fact, the odds of winning a jackpot on a slot machine are about 1 in every 26,000 spins.

This compares to just 1 in every 175 spins for craps, 1 in every 613 spins for blackjack, and 1 in every 220 spins for roulette.

So if you're looking to gamble and want to have the best chance of winning, stick to the slot machines!

#  Maryland to Allow Slot Machines Only at Race Tracks and Casinos 

Governor vetoes measure to expand gambling; slot machines to be only at race tracks and casinos
 

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland's governor vetoed a measure Thursday that would have allowed slot machines at five additional locations, including two shopping malls and a racetrack in Baltimore City.

Instead, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he will sign a different bill that would allow slot machines only at race tracks and casinos. That bill passed the House of Delegates last week on a 98-37 vote. The Senate approved the bill 33-13 last month.

Hogan announced his decision in a news conference at the State House surrounded by opponents of expanded gambling, including some Democrats who joined him in opposing the measure. He said there were too many unanswered questions about how expansion would work, including how it would impact education funding and the state budget.

"This is not something I take lightly," Hogan said of his veto. "But I'm going to do the right thing for Marylanders." 

The vetoed measure would have allowed up to 15,500 slot machines at five locations other than the state's five casinos: Arundel Mills mall in Hanover, Cromwell Bridge mall in Baltimore County, Ocean Downs racetrack near Ocean City, Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Allegany County and Rosecroft Raceway in Prince George's County. 

Del. Eric Luedtke, a Montgomery County Democrat who opposed the expansion measure, called Hogan's decision "a victory for democracy." 
"The voices of tens of thousands of people who oppose this bill have been heard by the governor," Luedtke said in a statement. 
Racetracks and casinos have been heavily lobbying for years for expanded gambling in Maryland, arguing it is needed to help them compete with neighboring states that have more gambling options. The General Assembly has considered measures to expand gambling almost every year since 2010.

#  Proposed Bill in Pennsylvania Seeks to Limit Slot Machine Use to Casinos 

In February, a proposed bill was submitted to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives that would limit slot machine use to casinos only. The bill, HB271, was authored by Mike Turzai, Speaker of the House.

The purpose of the bill is to “restrict the use of slot machines to casinos in order to protect Pennsylvania’s citizens and its economy.” According to Turzai, the state is losing out on revenue from slots because they can be found in other venues such as truck stops and racetracks. He also contends that having slots in other venues has led to an increase in gambling addiction and social problems.

The bill has been referred to the House Gaming Oversight Committee for further action.

#  Delaware Considers Allowing Slot Machines Only at Slaughterhouses

The idea of having slot machines at slaughterhouses has been gaining some traction in Delaware, as policymakers consider it as a potential new revenue stream amid fiscal woes.

One of the key proponents of the idea is Democratic state Rep. John Viola, who believes that allowing slot machines only at slaughterhouses would be a safe and sensible way to regulate gambling in the state.

“I think it’s a great idea. It would be a good way to help our agricultural industry, and it would be a good way to provide some additional revenue for the state,” Viola said.

He estimates that if the measure were to be approved, it could bring in an additional $5 million annually for Delaware. That money could then be put towards things like education or infrastructure improvements.

Currently, there are no casinos or other places where gambling is legal in Delaware outside of horse racing tracks. And while there are no current plans to allow slot machines or any other form of gambling at slaughterhouses specifically, the possibility is being discussed as state officials look for ways to address Delaware’s budget shortfall.

Opposition to the proposal has been vocal, with some people arguing that it would lead to more crime and addiction problems. But supporters argue that such concerns are overblown and that regulating gambling at slaughterhouses would actually help keep things under control.
